# Algorithms-Book-Solutions
In this repository, you'll find solutions to various problems from the renowned book "Algorithms" by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
This repo is a work in progress. Incomplete chapters are marked accordingly to indicate the ongoing nature of this project. Currently I am
writing solutions in a word document and uploading in PDF format for easy reference, but for viewing changes I may shift to writing solutions
in LaTex and uploading tex files along with PDF. Problems requiring algorithmic solutions are also implemented in C++ to provide a deeper
understanding of the concepts. I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from fellow enthusiasts. If you spot an issue, have an
improvement suggestion, or simply want to share your thoughts, feel free to reach out to me at #usamatayyab9@gmail.com
